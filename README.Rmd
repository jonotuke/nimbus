# nimbus

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of nimbus is to simulate cloud cover and add it to raster files. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of nimbus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonotuke/nimbus")
```

## Example

First we load the package. 

```{r example}
library(nimbus)
## basic example code
```

We will illustrate by adding a cloud cover to the example raster. First we look at the example raster

```{r}
library(raster)
plot(example_raster)
```

We will simulate a $70 \times 70$ pixels cloud

```{r, cache=TRUE}
cloud <- simulate_cloud(phi = 0.1, seed = 2023)
```

```{r}
plot(cloud)
```
